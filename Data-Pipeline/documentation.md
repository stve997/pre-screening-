Approach
In order to create a framework to source real-time data, there are 3 basic components we need as follows,
1.	Data source that can enable change tracking or change data capture (CDC)
2.	Streaming or messaging brokers
3.	Data Consumers or Processors
Setting up a real-time data streaming pipeline from SQL and NoSQL databases using Kafka, Spark, NiFi, and Airflow involves several steps, from data extraction to processing, and orchestration. 

Implementation.
Note: The choice of whether to install data processing tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and Apache NiFi on the same machine or on separate machines depends on several factors, including the scale of your data processing needs, your system's resources, and the desired architecture
1]Data Source Configuration:
Identify the SQL-based and NoSQL-based databases you want to stream data from.
Ensure that both SQL and NoSQL databases are properly configured and accessible from your streaming pipeline.
2]Set Up Kafka:
Set up Apache Kafka as the central message broker for real-time data streaming.
Deploy Kafka clusters and configure topics to capture data changes for data ingestion .
3]Apache NiFi Configuration:
Install and configure Apache NiFi.
Use NiFi to extract, transform, and route data(to align with the desired output schema) from SQL and NoSQL databases to Kafka.
Set up NiFi processors to connect to your databases and establish CDC (Change Data Capture) mechanisms to capture real-time data changes.
Use NiFi processors to publish the transformed data to Kafka topics.
Each topic corresponds to a specific data source or data type.
4]Set Up Spark:
Set up Apache Spark clusters for real-time data processing. Configure Spark Streaming to consume data from Kafka topics.
Design Spark jobs to process and analyze the incoming data in real-time.
Implement transformations, aggregations, or any specific processing steps relevant to your use case.
After processing the data, use Spark to write the results to analytical databases(NoSQL) for storage.
Ensure that the schema of the processed data matches the requirements of your analytical databases.
5]Apache Airflow Setup:
Deploy Apache Airflow for orchestrating and scheduling data pipeline tasks.
Create Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to define and manage the workflow for data streaming and processing tasks.
Schedule Airflow tasks to run at specific intervals or in response to events.
Ensure that tasks are orchestrated in the desired order, ensuring that data flows smoothly from extraction through processing to storage.
6] Real-Time Output:
If you need to visualize real-time data, develop a real-time dashboard using a tool like Grafana to display insights from your streaming data.
7] Monitoring and Error Handling
Implement monitoring solutions to track the health and performance of your streaming pipeline. 
Set up alerts and notifications for critical issues.
8] Security:
Implement security measures to protect data in transit and at rest. Use encryption and access controls to secure sensitive data.
